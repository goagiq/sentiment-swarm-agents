**Complementary Actions**:
- Balance primary strategy with complementary approaches
- Develop hybrid capabilities and flexibility
- Maintain strategic options and adaptability

## Customizing the Analysis

### Modifying Strategic Data
You can customize the analysis by modifying the strategic data in the script:

```python
strategic_data = {
    "the_way": {
        "organizational_culture": 85,  # Modify these values
        "stakeholder_alignment": 78,
        "purpose_clarity": 82,
        "values_consistency": 80
    },
    "heaven": {
        "market_timing": 75,
        "economic_conditions": 70,
        "seasonal_factors": 85,
        "external_pressures": 65
    },
    # ... other fundamentals
}
```

### Adding New Scenarios
You can extend the analysis by adding new scenario types:

```python
def analyze_new_strategy(self, data):
    """Analyze a new strategic scenario."""
    new_metrics = {
        "capability_1": data["fundamental"]["metric"] * weight,
        "capability_2": data["fundamental"]["metric"] * weight,
        # ... more metrics
    }
    return new_metrics
```

### Adjusting Weights
Modify the weighting factors to reflect your strategic priorities:

```python
defensive_metrics = {
    "positional_advantage": data["earth"]["market_position"] * 0.3 + data["earth"]["geographic_advantage"] * 0.7,
    # Adjust these weights based on your strategic focus
}
```
