# Knowledge Graph Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Knowledge Graph Agent that integrates seamlessly with the existing sentiment analysis system. The agent extracts entities, maps relationships, and builds a knowledge graph from various content types while maintaining compliance with the existing codebase architecture.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Knowledge Graph Agent (`src/agents/knowledge_graph_agent.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Entity extraction from text, audio, video, webpages, PDFs, and social media
- Relationship mapping between entities using natural language understanding
- Graph analysis including community detection and path finding
- Visual graph report generation
- Integration with existing ChromaDB and Ollama models

**Key Methods:**
- `extract_entities()` - Extract entities from content
- `map_relationships()` - Map relationships between entities
- `query_knowledge_graph()` - Query the knowledge graph
- `generate_graph_report()` - Generate visual graph reports
- `analyze_graph_communities()` - Analyze graph communities
- `find_entity_paths()` - Find paths between entities
- `get_entity_context()` - Get entity context and connections

### 2. MCP Server Integration (`src/mcp/knowledge_graph_agent_server.py`)

**Available MCP Tools:**
1. `extract_entities` - Extract entities from text
2. `map_relationships` - Map relationships between entities
3. `query_knowledge_graph` - Query the knowledge graph
4. `generate_graph_report` - Generate visual graph reports
5. `analyze_graph_communities` - Analyze graph communities
6. `find_entity_paths` - Find paths between entities
7. `get_entity_context` - Get entity context
8. `process_content` - Process content and build graph

### 3. Configuration Integration (`src/config/config.py`)

Added knowledge graph specific configuration:
```python
# Knowledge Graph settings
knowledge_graph_agent_capacity: int = 5
graph_storage_path: str = "./data/knowledge_graphs"
enable_graph_visualization: bool = True
max_graph_nodes: int = 10000
max_graph_edges: int = 50000
```

### 4. Demo and Test Scripts

**Demo Script (`examples/knowledge_graph_agent_demo.py`):**
- Comprehensive demonstration of all agent capabilities
- Sample data processing (technology companies, COVID-19 information)
- Individual tool testing
- Graph statistics and visualization

**Test Script (`Test/test_knowledge_graph_agent.py`):**

- Error handling verification
- Integration testing with existing components

### 5. Documentation (`docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_AGENT_GUIDE.md`)

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Architecture overview
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement suggestions

from src.core.models import AnalysisRequest, DataType

agent = KnowledgeGraphAgent()
request = AnalysisRequest(
    data_type=DataType.TEXT,
    content="Your content here",
    language="en"
)
result = await agent.process(request)
```

### Individual Tools
```python
# Extract entities
entities = await agent.extract_entities(text)

# Map relationships
relationships = await agent.map_relationships(text, entities)

# Generate visual report
report = await agent.generate_graph_report()

# Query the graph
results = await agent.query_knowledge_graph("your query")
```

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
