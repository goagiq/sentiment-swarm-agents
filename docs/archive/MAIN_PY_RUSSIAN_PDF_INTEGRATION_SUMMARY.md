# Main.py Russian PDF Processing Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to `main.py` and related files to integrate the enhanced Russian PDF processing capabilities that were previously implemented in the entity extraction agent.

## Problem Statement

The user reported that Russian PDF processing stopped working after improvements were made to Chinese PDF processing. The issue was that while the `entity_extraction_agent.py` had been enhanced with Russian language support, the main application (`main.py`) needed to be updated to properly utilize these enhancements and provide user-friendly access to the Russian PDF processing capabilities.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced PDF Processing Tool

Added a new MCP tool `process_pdf_enhanced_multilingual` to `main.py` that provides comprehensive Russian PDF processing capabilities:

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Detects Russian, Chinese, and English content automatically
- **Enhanced Entity Extraction**: Uses language-specific patterns, dictionaries, and LLM-based extraction
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Creates interactive HTML reports with Russian language support
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics and analysis results

#### Tool Implementation:
```python
@self.mcp.tool(description="Process PDF with enhanced multilingual entity extraction and knowledge graph generation")
async def process_pdf_enhanced_multilingual(
    pdf_path: str,
    language: str = "auto",
    generate_report: bool = True,
    output_path: str = None
):
    """Process PDF file with enhanced multilingual entity extraction and knowledge graph generation.
    
    This tool specifically supports Russian, Chinese, and English PDFs with enhanced entity extraction
    using language-specific patterns, dictionaries, and LLM-based extraction methods.
    """
```

#### Processing Pipeline:
1. **File Validation**: Checks if PDF file exists and is accessible
2. **Text Extraction**: Uses `FileExtractionAgent` to extract text content
3. **Language Detection**: Automatically detects language if "auto" is specified
4. **Enhanced Entity Extraction**: Uses `KnowledgeGraphAgent` with enhanced multilingual support
5. **Report Generation**: Creates interactive HTML reports with language-specific visualizations

### 2. Updated Tool Registration

Updated the tool registration system to include the new enhanced PDF processing tool:

#### Changes Made:
- **Tool Count**: Updated from 48 to 49 tools
- **Tool Lists**: Added `process_pdf_enhanced_multilingual` to all tool lists in `get_mcp_tools_info()`
- **Documentation**: Updated tool descriptions and availability information

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Validation

Improved error handling and validation for PDF processing:

#### Features Added:
- **File Existence Validation**: Checks if PDF file exists before processing
- **Extraction Success Validation**: Verifies that text was successfully extracted
- **Language Detection Validation**: Ensures language detection works correctly
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Provides helpful error messages and suggestions

### 4. Integration with Existing Infrastructure

The new tool integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure:

#### Integration Points:
- **FileExtractionAgent**: Uses existing PDF text extraction capabilities
- **KnowledgeGraphAgent**: Leverages enhanced multilingual entity extraction
- **Language Configuration**: Uses existing `language_specific_config.py` for language detection
- **Font Configuration**: Utilizes existing font configuration for proper rendering
- **Report Generation**: Uses existing HTML report generation with language-specific features

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Import Statements

The tool uses existing imports and adds specific imports for enhanced functionality:

```python
from src.agents.file_extraction_agent import FileExtractionAgent
from src.core.models import AnalysisRequest, DataType
from src.config.language_specific_config import detect_primary_language
```

### 2. Language Detection Integration

Integrates with the existing language detection system:

```python
# Detect language if auto is specified
detected_language = language
if language == "auto":
    from src.config.language_specific_config import detect_primary_language
    detected_language = detect_primary_language(text_content)
    print(f"üåç Detected language: {detected_language}")
```

### 3. Enhanced Entity Extraction

Uses the enhanced multilingual entity extraction capabilities:

```python
# Process with knowledge graph agent using enhanced multilingual support
print(f"üß† Processing with enhanced multilingual entity extraction for language: {detected_language}")
kg_request = AnalysisRequest(
    data_type=DataType.TEXT,
    content=text_content,
    language=detected_language
)

kg_result = await self.agents["knowledge_graph"].process(kg_request)
```

### 4. Report Generation

Generates comprehensive reports with language-specific features:

```python
# Generate report if requested
if generate_report:
    print(f"üìä Generating knowledge graph report...")
    if not output_path:
        from datetime import datetime
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
        output_path = f"Results/reports/enhanced_multilingual_pdf_{detected_language}_{timestamp}"
    
    report_result = await self.agents["knowledge_graph"].generate_graph_report(
        output_path=output_path,
        target_language=detected_language
    )
```

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Integration Test Created

Created `Test/test_main_russian_pdf_integration.py` to verify the integration:

#### Test Coverage:
- **Language Detection**: Verifies Russian language detection works correctly
- **Enhanced Extraction Configuration**: Confirms enhanced extraction is enabled for Russian
- **File Extraction Agent**: Tests PDF text extraction with Russian content
- **Knowledge Graph Agent**: Tests entity extraction and knowledge graph processing
