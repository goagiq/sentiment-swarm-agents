## üîç Key Findings & Insights

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
1. **Configuration System**: Flexible and extensible for multiple languages
2. **Pattern-Based Extraction**: Fast and effective for known patterns
3. **Dictionary-Based Extraction**: High accuracy for common entities
4. **Performance**: Excellent speed with sub-millisecond extraction times
5. **Multi-Strategy Pipeline**: Combines multiple approaches for better coverage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Entity Validation**: Organization and location validation needs refinement
2. **Technical Terms**: Only 50% accuracy for technical concepts
3. **Pattern Refinement**: Some patterns are too broad (extracting partial entities)
4. **LLM Integration**: LLM-based extraction not yet fully integrated

### üîß **Technical Issues Identified**
1. **Validation Rules**: Organization validation too strict (requires suffixes)
2. **Pattern Overlap**: Some patterns extract overlapping entities
3. **Entity Boundaries**: Pattern extraction doesn't respect word boundaries
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Could be more sophisticated
