# Phase 1 Error Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the error fixes completed during Phase 1 of the agent consolidation and optimization project.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ImportError: unified_video_analysis
**Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'unified_video_analysis' from 'agents.orchestrator_agent'`

**Root Cause**: During the refactoring of `OrchestratorAgent`, the `unified_video_analysis` function was moved from `orchestrator_agent.py` to `tool_registry.py`, but `main.py` was still trying to import it from the old location.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `main.py` import statement to remove the direct import of `unified_video_analysis`
- Added import for `ToolRegistry` from `core.tool_registry`
- Updated the function call in `analyze_video_unified` to use `ToolRegistry().execute_tool("unified_video_analysis", {"video_input": video_input})`

### 2. Logger Import Issues
**Problem**: Multiple service files were importing `loguru.logger` which was causing import errors.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `from loguru import logger` with `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` in all service files:
  - `src/core/processing_service.py`
  - `src/core/caching_service.py`
  - `src/core/error_handling_service.py`
  - `src/core/model_management_service.py`
  - `src/core/tool_registry.py`
  - `src/agents/entity_extraction_agent.py`

### 3. Service Import Issues
**Problem**: The `entity_extraction_agent.py` was trying to import service instances that didn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Updated imports to use service classes instead of instances
- Modified the agent constructor to instantiate the services:
  ```python
  self.model_management_service = ModelManagementService()
  self.processing_service = ProcessingService()
  self.error_handling_service = ErrorHandlingService()
  ```

## Verification
All fixes have been verified through successful imports and initialization:
- ✅ `ToolRegistry` import successful
- ✅ `OptimizedMCPServer` import successful  
- ✅ `ToolRegistry` initialization successful

## Remaining Linter Issues
While the critical runtime errors have been fixed, there are still some linter warnings (line length, unused imports) in the service files. These are non-critical and don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps
With the ImportError fixed, we can now proceed to **Phase 2** of the consolidation plan, which includes:
1. Completing the Knowledge Graph Agent Split
2. Merging OCR and File Extraction capabilities
3. Integrating Translation Service into unified agents
4. Consolidating Video Processing
