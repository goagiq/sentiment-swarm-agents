## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 The Five Fundamentals (五事)
Sun Tzu identified five fundamental factors for strategic success:

1. **The Way (道) - Moral Influence**
   - Alignment of purpose and values
   - Organizational culture and commitment
   - Stakeholder engagement

2. **Heaven (天) - Timing and Conditions**
   - Market conditions and trends
   - Economic cycles and external factors
   - Seasonal patterns and timing

3. **Earth (地) - Terrain and Position**
   - Market positioning and geography
   - Resource availability and constraints
   - Competitive landscape

4. **Command (将) - Leadership**
   - Decision-making capabilities
   - Strategic vision and execution
   - Management effectiveness

5. **Method (法) - Organization and Discipline**
   - Systems and processes
   - Resource allocation and efficiency
   - Operational excellence

### 1.2 Seven Considerations (七计)
For evaluating strategic position:

1. **Which ruler has the moral influence?**
2. **Which general has the greater ability?**
3. **Which side has the advantages of heaven and earth?**
4. **Which side has the better discipline?**
5. **Which side has the stronger forces?**
6. **Which side has the better trained officers and men?**
7. **Which side has the clearer rewards and punishments?**

## 2. Strategic Analysis Framework

### 2.1 Competitive Intelligence Analysis
Using the Advanced Analytics System to analyze competitive dynamics:

```python
# Competitive Analysis Framework
competitive_data = {
    "market_share": [30, 25, 20, 15, 10],  # Our position
    "competitor_strength": [85, 90, 75, 80, 70],  # Competitor capabilities
    "market_growth": [5, 8, 12, 6, 9],  # Market expansion
    "customer_satisfaction": [88, 82, 85, 78, 90],  # Customer metrics
    "innovation_index": [75, 80, 70, 85, 65]  # Innovation capability
}
```

### 2.2 SWOT Analysis with Analytics
Enhanced SWOT analysis using predictive modeling:

- **Strengths**: Internal capabilities and advantages
- **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations and vulnerabilities
- **Opportunities**: External favorable conditions
- **Threats**: External challenges and risks

### 2.3 Strategic Positioning Matrix
Using forecasting to determine optimal positioning:

```python
# Strategic Positioning Analysis
positioning_data = {
    "cost_leadership": [85, 90, 88, 92, 87],
    "differentiation": [75, 80, 82, 78, 85],
    "focus_strategy": [70, 75, 72, 80, 73],
    "market_penetration": [60, 65, 68, 70, 72]
}
```

## 3. Advanced Analytics Applications

### 3.1 Forecasting Market Conditions (Heaven - 天)

**Principle**: "Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons."

**Application**: Use multivariate forecasting to predict market trends:

```bash
# Market Trend Forecasting
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/advanced-analytics/forecasting/multivariate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [
      {"date": "2023-01-01", "market_growth": 5.2, "interest_rate": 3.5, "inflation": 2.1},
      {"date": "2023-02-01", "market_growth": 5.8, "interest_rate": 3.8, "inflation": 2.3}
    ],
    "target_variables": ["market_growth", "interest_rate", "inflation"],
    "forecast_horizon": 12,
    "model_type": "ensemble"
  }'
```

**Strategic Insights**:
- Predict market cycles and timing
- Identify optimal entry/exit points
- Anticipate economic conditions

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape Analysis (Earth - 地)

**Principle**: "Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death."

**Application**: Use clustering and anomaly detection to map competitive terrain:

```bash
# Competitive Landscape Analysis
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/advanced-analytics/ml/clustering \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [
      [85, 90, 75, 80],  # Competitor A: [market_share, strength, innovation, efficiency]
      [70, 75, 85, 90],  # Competitor B
      [90, 85, 70, 75],  # Competitor C
      [75, 80, 90, 85]   # Competitor D
    ],
    "method": "kmeans",
    "n_clusters": 3
  }'
```

**Strategic Insights**:
- Identify competitive clusters
- Find positioning opportunities
- Map market gaps and niches

### 3.3 Leadership Effectiveness Analysis (Command - 将)

**Principle**: "The general stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness."

**Application**: Use causal analysis to measure leadership impact:

```bash
# Leadership Impact Analysis
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/advanced-analytics/causal/analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [
      {"leadership_change": 1, "performance": 85, "employee_satisfaction": 78, "market_position": 75},
      {"leadership_change": 0, "performance": 82, "employee_satisfaction": 75, "market_position": 72}
    ],
    "treatment_variable": "leadership_change",
    "outcome_variable": "performance",
    "method": "propensity_score"
  }'
```

**Strategic Insights**:
- Measure leadership effectiveness
- Identify key success factors
- Optimize decision-making processes

### 3.4 Organizational Efficiency Analysis (Method - 法)

**Principle**: "Method and discipline are to be understood as the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure."

**Application**: Use anomaly detection to identify operational inefficiencies:

```bash
# Operational Efficiency Analysis
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/advanced-analytics/anomaly/detection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [85, 87, 89, 92, 88, 90, 91, 89, 87, 85, 82, 88, 90, 92, 89],
    "method": "isolation_forest",
    "threshold": 0.95
  }'
```

**Strategic Insights**:
- Identify operational bottlenecks
- Detect performance anomalies
- Optimize resource allocation
